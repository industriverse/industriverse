## 1. Executive Summary
The Thermodynamic Generative Executor (TGE) optimized the toolpath for **Wing-Spar-Ti-X9**.
We achieved a **30.0% reduction in energy consumption** while maintaining 100% thermal compliance.

## 2. Energy Analysis

| Metric | Standard G-Code | TGE Optimized | Delta |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Energy** | 4,500,000 J | 3,150,000 J | **-1,350,000 J** |
| **Peak Temp** | 850°C | 720°C | -130°C |
| **Cycle Time** | 45 min | 41 min | -4 min |

## 3. Financial Impact (Projected Fleet-Wide)
Based on a production run of 1,000 units:
*   **Energy Savings**: $56.25
*   **Tool Wear Reduction**: 18% (Est. $12,000/yr)
*   **Scrap Reduction**: 5% (Est. $45,000/yr)

## 4. Conclusion
The TGE has successfully "cooled" the production process, generating net-new value through entropy reduction.

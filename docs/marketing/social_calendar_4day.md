# Social Launch Calendar (4-Day Rollout)

## DAY 1: 'We Are Here' (The Announcement)

### Empeiria Haus (Research)
> "We are Empeiria Haus. A lab dedicated to solving civilization-scale physics problems. 10 Grand Challenges. 10 Engines. 1 Mission: The Thermodynamic Organism."

### Industriverse (Engineering)
> "The 'Dark Factory' is real. It is self-healing, zero-drift, and price-aware. Powered by Chronos, Kairos, Telos, and Aletheia. Code drops tomorrow."

### Thermodynasty (Vision)
> "Intelligence is thermodynamic. Every decision costs energy. We are building the economics of tomorrow."

## DAY 2: 'Proof of Work' (The Giant Demo)

### Empeiria Haus
> "Zero-Drift Manufacturing is solved. Our DriftCanceller computes inverse thermal vectors in real-time. Physics-Sovereign AI is here."

### Industriverse
> "We ran the Giant Demo. 08:15 Entropy Climb -> 08:17 Zero-Drift Correction -> 08:20 Negentropy Minted. Watch the logs."

### Thermodynasty
> "Factories that negotiate. Machines that trade. This is the Industrial Singularity."

## DAY 3: 'Client Solutions' (The Architect)

### Empeiria Haus
> "We solve hard problems. 
Problem: Spindle Failure. 
Solution: Ultra-Early Failure Prediction: Detecting entropy climbs before they happen. (Modules: EBDMForecaster, VisualTwin, TelosClassifier)"

### Industriverse
> "Client Request: 'Optimize my energy bill.'
Deployed: Thermodynamic Scheduling: Execution based on real-time energy arbitrage.
Result: 30% OpEx reduction via Kairos."

### Thermodynasty
> "Entropy is the most expensive bill you pay. We turn it into equity."

## DAY 4: 'The Movement' (The Standard)

### Empeiria Haus
> "Releasing TOS-1: The Thermodynamic Orchestration Standard. The protocol for the next industrial era."

### Industriverse
> "Opening Early Access for 5 Pilot Factories. Deploy the Quadrality Engine today."

### Thermodynasty
> "The Thermodynamic Manifesto. Join the movement."

# Hypothesis Engine: Topic Ideas & Use Cases

**Context:** Enabled by **Dynamic Loader** (Hot-Swap, Context-Aware) and **Text-to-LoRA** (Rapid Adaptation).

## 1. Material Science Discovery
*   **Topic:** *Adaptive Catalyst Discovery*
    *   **Mechanism:** UserLM defines target properties (e.g., "lower activation energy"). RND1 generates candidate structures. T2L creates a "Catalyst-Chemist" LoRA trained on recent papers. Dynamic Loader swaps this LoRA into the simulation engine.
    *   **Hypothesis:** "Doping Graphene with Boron will increase catalytic efficiency for reaction X by 15%."
*   **Topic:** *Polymer Degradation Analysis*
    *   **Mechanism:** Loader injects a "UV-Damage" physics model into the digital twin. T2L generates a LoRA specialized in polymer chain scission logic.

## 2. Energy Optimization (EDCoC)
*   **Topic:** *Real-Time Grid Balancing*
    *   **Mechanism:** EDCoC nodes request a "Peak-Load" inference model during high demand. Dynamic Loader streams partial weights to edge devices.
    *   **Hypothesis:** "Shifting load Z to battery bank Y during t=14:00 will reduce thermal stress by 5%."
*   **Topic:** *Turbine Wake Steering*
    *   **Mechanism:** Wind farm DACs swap in a "Wake-Interaction" model when wind direction changes.

## 3. Manufacturing Process Control
*   **Topic:** *Defect Prediction in Casting*
    *   **Mechanism:** Camera feeds detect a new alloy type. ACE triggers Dynamic Loader to swap from "Steel-Defect-v1" to "Titanium-Defect-v1" (generated by T2L overnight).
    *   **Hypothesis:** "Cooling rate adjustment of -2°C/s will prevent porosity in the new alloy."
*   **Topic:** *Predictive Maintenance 2.0*
    *   **Mechanism:** Vibration sensor detects anomaly. Loader swaps in a heavy "Vibration-Analysis-70B" model for 1 minute to diagnose, then reverts to lightweight monitoring.

## 4. Supply Chain & Logistics
*   **Topic:** *Dynamic Route Optimization*
    *   **Mechanism:** Weather event detected. T2L generates a "Storm-Routing" heuristic layer. Loader applies it to the logistics engine.
    *   **Hypothesis:** "Rerouting via Node B avoids the storm delay but increases fuel cost by 2%. Net benefit positive."

## 5. Bio-Industrial Applications
*   **Topic:** *Enzyme Engineering*
    *   **Mechanism:** RND1 proposes amino acid substitutions. T2L adapts the protein folding model for the specific enzyme family.
    *   **Hypothesis:** "Mutation K45R will increase thermal stability at 60°C."

## 6. Meta-Learning (The "Conscious" Layer)
*   **Topic:** *Self-Correction of Logic*
    *   **Mechanism:** ACE detects RND1 failing at math problems. T2L generates a "Math-Logic" adapter. Loader injects it whenever equations are detected.
    *   **Hypothesis:** "Using the Math-Logic adapter will reduce calculation errors by 90%."

    *   **RND1 (Physics Builder)**: Implemented.
    *   **BitNet**: Edge inference ready.
2.  **Integrate Physics Priors**
    *   Hydro, heat, energy, tensor models.
    *   Conservation-based rule sets.
3.  **CFR Fossilization Engine**
    *   Every discovery becomes a permanent "memory crystal".
    *   **Action**: Hardening `CFRLogger` for rich metadata.
4.  **Energy Atlas (v1)**
    *   First-generation entropy maps.
    *   **Action**: Ingesting "Primordial Soup" (Physics/Ego4D datasets).
5.  **ResourceCluster Explorer**
    *   Identify "Opportunity Zones".

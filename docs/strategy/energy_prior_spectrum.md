# The Energy Prior Spectrum

**"The Source of Truth for Potential Energy"**

Empeiria Haus does not create energy; it organizes it.
This document defines the "Threads" of potential energy that the system pulls from to minimize Free Energy in the factory.

## The 5 Threads of Potential

### 1. The Thermal Thread (Heat)
*   **Definition**: The chaotic vibration of atoms. Waste energy.
*   **The Goal**: Minimize thermal variance.
*   **The Prior**: "A perfect process generates zero waste heat."
*   **Metric**: Temperature Delta (ΔT).

### 2. The Kinetic Thread (Motion)
*   **Definition**: The movement of mass through space.
*   **The Goal**: Minimize jerk (derivative of acceleration).
*   **The Prior**: "The smoothest path is the most efficient."
*   **Metric**: Jerk (m/s³).

### 3. The Electromagnetic Thread (Power)
*   **Definition**: The flow of electrons.
*   **The Goal**: Maximize work per watt.
*   **The Prior**: "Every electron must contribute to the product."
*   **Metric**: Power Factor (PF).

### 4. The Information Thread (Bits)
*   **Definition**: The reduction of uncertainty.
*   **The Goal**: Minimize description length (Kolmogorov Complexity).
*   **The Prior**: "The simplest explanation is the correct one."
*   **Metric**: Bitrate / Model Size.

### 5. The Economic Thread (Value)
*   **Definition**: The exchange of utility.
*   **The Goal**: Maximize ROI (Return on Innovation).
*   **The Prior**: "Value is generated when entropy is reduced."
*   **Metric**: Cost per Unit ($).

## The Pull Mechanism
The **Thermodynamic Generative Executor (TGE)** "pulls" from these threads simultaneously.

*   It pulls from the **Kinetic Thread** to smooth the robot's arm.
*   It pulls from the **Thermal Thread** to slow down the cut and prevent overheating.
*   It pulls from the **Economic Thread** to ensure the part is profitable.

The result is a **Pareto-Optimal Frontier**—a state of balance where no thread can be improved without degrading another.

# 10 Immediate Value Opportunities: "Hidden Cohesions"

## Overview
We have 27 operational Sovereign Capsules. While valuable individually, their true power emerges when they are linked. These "Hidden Cohesions" allow thermodynamic state to flow from one domain to another, creating self-optimizing industrial chains. We can build and sell these **today**.

### 1. The "Infinite Energy" Stability Chain
**Capsules**: `fusion_v1` → `grid_v1` → `microgrid_v1`
**The Hidden Cohesion**:
-   `fusion_v1` minimizes plasma instability (entropy).
-   This "clean" energy state is passed to `grid_v1` as a frequency stability prior.

**Value**: A demo showing how fusion stability directly stabilizes a neighborhood grid.
**Target**: DOE, Utility Companies.

**Capsules**: `wafer_v1` → `pcbmfg_v1` → `electronics_v1`
**The Hidden Cohesion**:
-   `wafer_v1` detects thermal anomalies during lithography.
-   Instead of discarding, it passes the "Risk Map" to `pcbmfg_v1`.
-   `pcbmfg_v1` adjusts soldering temperatures *specifically* for the risky zones.
**Value**: Recovering 5-10% of "lost" yield through downstream adaptation.
**Target**: TSMC, Intel, Nvidia.

### 3. The "Perfect Powertrain" Loop
**Capsules**: `battery_v1` → `motor_v1` → `chassis_v1`
**The Hidden Cohesion**:
-   `battery_v1` monitors chemical degradation entropy.

**Target**: Tesla, Rivian, Ford.

### 4. The "Raw-to-Part" Traceability Tunnel
**Capsules**: `metal_v1` → `casting_v1` → `cnc_v1`
**The Hidden Cohesion**:
-   `metal_v1` records the exact alloy composition entropy.
-   `casting_v1` adjusts cooling rates based on that specific alloy batch.

**Value**: Adaptive manufacturing that treats every metal batch as unique.
**Target**: SpaceX, Blue Origin (Rocket Engines).

### 5. The "Sustainable Fashion" Cycle
**Capsules**: `chem_v1` → `polymer_v1` → `apparel_v1`
**The Hidden Cohesion**:
-   `chem_v1` optimizes dye synthesis for low toxicity.
-   `polymer_v1` aligns fiber tension to maximize durability.
-   `apparel_v1` predicts fabric drape and wear patterns before cutting.
**Value**: Reducing textile waste by predicting material failure before sewing.
**Target**: Nike, Lululemon, Inditex.

### 6. The "Resilient Infrastructure" Shield
**Capsules**: `heat_v1` → `pipeline_v1` → `failure_v1`
**The Hidden Cohesion**:
-   `heat_v1` models thermal expansion cycles.
-   `pipeline_v1` detects stress concentrations in real-time.
-   `failure_v1` predicts rupture probability and auto-routes flow to bypass risks.
**Value**: Self-healing pipelines that prevent leaks before they happen.
**Target**: ExxonMobil, Shell, Kinder Morgan.

### 7. The "Safe-Zone" Factory Floor
**Capsules**: `robotics_v1` → `assembly_v1` → `amrsafety_v1`
**The Hidden Cohesion**:
-   `robotics_v1` broadcasts its kinematic energy envelope.
-   `amrsafety_v1` creates dynamic "exclusion zones" for humans.
-   `assembly_v1` slows down the line only when humans enter high-entropy zones.
**Value**: Maximizing throughput without compromising worker safety.
**Target**: Amazon Robotics, BMW, Toyota.

### 8. The "Quantum Quality" Eye
**Capsules**: `sensorint_v1` → `surface_v1` → `qctherm_v1`
**The Hidden Cohesion**:
-   `sensorint_v1` fuses Lidar and Camera data.
-   `surface_v1` detects micro-texture anomalies (scratches).
-   `qctherm_v1` correlates surface defects with internal thermal stress.
**Value**: Seeing "invisible" internal defects through surface patterns.
**Target**: Apple, Foxconn (Device Inspection).

### 9. The "Human-Centric" Shift
**Capsules**: `workforce_v1` → `schedule_v1` → `lifecycle_v1`
**The Hidden Cohesion**:
-   `workforce_v1` monitors biometric fatigue (anonymized entropy).
-   `schedule_v1` rotates high-focus tasks to fresh workers automatically.
-   `lifecycle_v1` predicts long-term retention based on burnout rates.
**Value**: AI that protects workers from burnout while optimizing output.
**Target**: Walmart, FedEx, UPS.

### 10. The "Grid-Component" Harmony
**Capsules**: `magnet_v1` → `motor_v1` → `grid_v1`
**The Hidden Cohesion**:
-   `magnet_v1` detects demagnetization risk in wind turbines.
-   `motor_v1` adjusts power factor to compensate.
-   `grid_v1` prepares for a slight dip in reactive power generation.
**Value**: Predictive maintenance that talks directly to the grid operator.
**Target**: Siemens Gamesa, GE Vernova.

## Execution Strategy
We can demo **ANY** of these today by:
1.  Instantiating the 3 relevant capsules.
2.  Wiring their TNN inputs/outputs in a simple script.
3.  Showing the "Energy Cascade" in the DAC UI.

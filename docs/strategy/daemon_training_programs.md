This curriculum trains operators to wield the **Discovery Accelerator** and manage **Singularity Mode**.

## Track 1: Certified Discovery Operator (Level 1-2)
**Target**: Data Scientists, ML Ops.
**Focus**: Managing Standard and Accelerated discovery loops.
**Curriculum**:
1.  **Trifecta Basics**: Tuning UserLM intents and ACE context.
2.  **Hypothesis Validation**: Interpreting ASAL and OBMI scores.
3.  **Safe Acceleration**: Moving from Standard to Accelerated gear.
4.  **Human-in-the-Loop**: Reviewing DAC deployment proposals.

## Track 2: Innovation Architect (Level 3)
**Target**: R&D Leads, Chief Scientists.
**Focus**: Managing Hyper mode (High Velocity).
**Curriculum**:
1.  **DGM Tuning**: Configuring Darwin-Godel mutation rates.
2.  **T2L Pipelines**: Managing the Text-to-LoRA factory.
3.  **Swarm Sensing**: Orchestrating ASAL swarms for data density.
4.  **Resource Balancing**: Allocating compute between Discovery and Optimization.

## Track 3: Singularity Strategist (Level 4)
**Target**: The Lithographer, Elite Visionaries.
**Focus**: Managing SINGULARITY (Code Red) mode.
**Curriculum**:
1.  **The Singularity Trigger**: When to engage Unbounded Innovation.
2.  **Recursive Safety**: Monitoring DGM self-improvement for alignment.
3.  **Flash Forge Ops**: Handling massive streams of transient LoRAs.
4.  **Auto-Deploy Governance**: Setting meta-rules for autonomous DAC spawning.
5.  **Resource Cannibalism**: Strategic trade-offs of starving optimization for discovery.

## Track 4: Capsule Geneticist (The Builder)
**Target**: Advanced Developers.
**Focus**: Building evolvable capsules.
**Curriculum**:
1.  **Evolutionary Code**: Writing capsules that DGM can mutate.
2.  **Self-Reporting Agents**: Implementing ASAL hooks in every agent.
3.  **LoRA-Ready Architecture**: Designing models for instant T2L adaptation.

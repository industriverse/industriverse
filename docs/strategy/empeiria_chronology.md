# The Empeiria Chronology: A Bible for the Data Hub Factory

**"What are we building every moment?"**

This document defines the 24/7 operational heartbeat of Empeiria Haus. It is the single source of truth for the Daemon's "Framework of Mastery".

## 1. The Core Philosophy
The Data Hub Factory does not just "process data". It **manufactures order**.
Every millisecond, the system pulls raw, chaotic data (High Entropy) from the world and refines it into structured, actionable intelligence (Low Entropy).

**The Product is Negentropy.**

---

## 2. The Framework of Mastery (The 4 Stages)
The Daemon orchestrates a continuous cycle of learning for every asset in the Industriverse.

### Stage 1: Observation (The Ingest Loop)
*   **Action**: The system watches the human master.
*   **Data**: Egocentric Video, Telemetry, Vibration.
*   **Goal**: Capture the "Trade Secret" (the subtle wrist flick, the thermal sweet spot).
*   **Daemon State**: `COLLECTING`

### Stage 2: Imitation (The Simulation Loop)
*   **Action**: The system attempts to replicate the observed action in the Digital Twin.
*   **Data**: Physics Simulation (TGE), Collision Detection.
*   **Goal**: Validate safety and feasibility.
*   **Daemon State**: `SIMULATING`

### Stage 3: Innovation (The Optimization Loop)
*   **Action**: The system improves upon the human baseline.
*   **Data**: Thermodynamic Analysis (Entropy Oracle).
*   **Goal**: Find the "Coolest Path" (Lowest Energy, Highest Quality).
*   **Daemon State**: `OPTIMIZING`

### Stage 4: Mastery (The Crystallization Loop)
*   **Action**: The system packages the optimized skill into a **Capsule**.
*   **Data**: ZK-Proof, PSSM Weight Update.
*   **Goal**: Deploy the skill to the global fleet.
*   **Daemon State**: `PUBLISHING`

## 3. The Control Chronology (24/7 Cycle)
The Daemon operates on a precise millisecond clock.

| Time | Action | Mastery Stage | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T+0ms** | **Ingest**: Pull data from EDCoC sensors. | Observation | Raw Shard |
| **T+10ms** | **Analyze**: Check Entropy & Anomalies. | Observation | Research Event |
| **T+50ms** | **Hypothesize**: Generate TGE toolpath candidates. | Imitation | Simulation Result |
| **T+200ms** | **Select**: Choose lowest-entropy path. | Innovation | Optimized Toolpath |
| **T+500ms** | **Execute**: Send command to robot. | Mastery | Physical Action |
| **T+1000ms** | **Verify**: Confirm result via ZK-Proof. | Mastery | ZK Certificate |

## 4. The Continuous Output
Even when the factory is "idle", Empeiria Haus is building:
1.  **Skill Capsules**: Refining the library of motion.
2.  **Trust**: Generating ZK-Proofs for past production.
3.  **Predictions**: Forecasting failures (PEM) before they happen.

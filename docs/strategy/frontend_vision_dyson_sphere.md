# Frontend Vision: Inside the Dyson Sphere

## The Metaphor
The user is not sitting at a desk; they are **inside the Dyson Sphere**. The interface is a "Portal" looking out at the universe of thermodynamic computation. The screen is a pane of "Obsidian Glass" floating in the void, displaying the high-energy processes of the Industriverse.

## The Aesthetic: "Stellar Obsidian"
*   **Base**: Deep, void-like blacks (`#050505`, `#0A0A0A`) representing the vacuum of space.
*   **Glass**: UI elements are semi-transparent, frosted glass panels with subtle refraction (Glassmorphism), as if projecting data onto a HUD.
*   **Energy**:
    *   **High Exergy (Value)**: Stellar White (`#FFFFFF`), Plasma Blue (`#00F0FF`), Solar Gold (`#FFD700`).
    *   **High Entropy (Chaos)**: Redshift Crimson (`#FF0055`).
    *   **Stability**: Nebula Purple (`#BC13FE`).
*   **Typography**:
    *   **Data**: Monospace (e.g., `JetBrains Mono`, `Fira Code`) for precision.
    *   **Narrative**: Elegant Sans (e.g., `Inter`, `Outfit`) for human readability.

## Ambient Intelligence (The "Aura")
The interface feels alive. It doesn't just display data; it "breathes."
*   **Micro-Animations**: Buttons glow when hovered, borders pulse with energy when processing, charts flow like liquid.
*   **Soundscapes (Optional)**: Subtle hums or clicks (haptic feedback) reinforce the feeling of operating heavy machinery.
*   **Anticipation**: The UI predicts the next step. If a simulation finishes, the "Mint Capsule" button materializes before the user asks.

## The 50 Demos: Visual Archetypes

### 1. Physics (The Reactor Core)
*   **Visuals**: Magnetic field lines, heat maps, particle flows.
*   **Vibe**: Intense, precise, dangerous but controlled.
*   **Key Components**: `Three.js` particle systems, `Recharts` real-time line graphs.

### 2. Bio/Chem (The Molecular Forge)
*   **Visuals**: 3D molecular structures, folding pathways, genetic sequences.
*   **Vibe**: Organic, fluid, intricate.
*   **Key Components**: `Three.js` molecule viewer, DNA helix spinners.

### 3. Space (The Star Chart)
*   **Visuals**: Orbital mechanics, star fields, spectrum analyzers.
*   **Vibe**: Vast, silent, strategic.
*   **Key Components**: `Three.js` orbital controls, radar sweeps.

### 4. Hardware (The Silicon Lattice)
*   **Visuals**: Circuit diagrams, bitstream flows, logic gates.
*   **Vibe**: Geometric, rigid, ultra-fast.
*   **Key Components**: SVG circuit animations, binary rain effects.

### 5. Economy (The Ledger Stream)
*   **Visuals**: Ledger flows, token streams, network graphs.
*   **Vibe**: Flowing, golden, transactional.

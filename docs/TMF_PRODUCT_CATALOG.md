## 🚀 The "Hero" Features (Cross-Product)

### A. The "Thermodynamic Model Card" (TMC)
Every product ships with a live, interactive HTML artifact that proves its physics compliance. It is not a PDF; it is a **running simulation**.

### B. Zero-Shot Physics Transfer
Our models do not need retraining for new physical environments. Change the `Energy Prior` file, and the model adapts instantly. This is our "Moat".

### C. The "Compliance-as-Code" Certificate
Each model deployment generates a `model.proof` file containing the ZKP of its training run, signed by the `Conservation Enforcer`.

# Industriverse Proof Economy & AI Shield v3 - Business Utility

## Core Utility
- Physics-layer security: Detect/prevent malicious computation via thermodynamic/UTID proofs.
- Verifiable AI: Every action/model load has a proof hash + UTID lineage.
- Proof-assisted orchestration: K8s resources carry UTID/proofScore for scheduling and audit.

## Use Cases
- Zero-day pre-execution defense: Stop attacks before payload executes using thermodynamic signatures.
- Supply chain assurance: UTID + proof hashes across deployments; ProofScore-driven admission.
- Compliance & audit: Proof DAG/lineage for regulators, with anchors and energy footprint.
- Model/IP protection: Proof-based access and throttling; provenance for model loads/LoRA artifacts.
- Industrial uptime: Shield throttles/quarantines based on real thermodynamic signals to prevent outages.

## Business Value
- Reduced breach risk and downtime; compliance readiness.
- New revenue: Proof-as-a-Service, ThermoSentinel appliances, audit reporting.
- Differentiation: Physics-aware, cryptographically verifiable AI platform.

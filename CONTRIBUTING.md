## Development Workflow

Our development workflow is designed to be efficient and to maintain a high level of code quality. All code contributions should be submitted as a pull request.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/industriverse.git
    cd industriverse
    ```
3.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix. Please use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/add-new-service`, `bugfix/fix-memory-leak`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies.** We recommend using a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 2: Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python.
- Add unit tests for any new features or bug fixes.
- Ensure that all existing tests pass.

### Step 3: Commit Your Changes

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This helps us automate changelog generation and makes the commit history more readable.

Your commit messages should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`

**Example:**

```
feat(api): Add new endpoint for user authentication

This commit introduces a new `/auth/login` endpoint that allows users to authenticate using JWTs. It includes validation, error handling, and integration with the user database.

Closes #42
```

### Step 4: Submit a Pull Request

1.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
2.  **Open a pull request** from your fork to the `main` branch of the `industriverse/industriverse` repository.
3.  **Fill out the pull request template** with a clear description of your changes.
4.  **Link any relevant issues** in your pull request description.

### Step 5: Code Review

- A project maintainer will review your pull request.
- Be prepared to make changes based on the feedback.
- Once your pull request is approved and all checks have passed, it will be merged into the `main` branch.

## Style Guides

- **Python:** We follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. We use `black` for automated code formatting and `isort` for import sorting.
- **Documentation:** We use Markdown for all documentation. Please follow standard Markdown syntax.

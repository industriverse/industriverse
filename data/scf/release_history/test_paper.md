# Self-Healing Industrial Control Systems: A Negentropy Approach

**Date:** 2025-12-04
**System Version:** 1.0.0

## Abstract
This week, the Sovereign Daemon focused on **System Negentropy**. We observed a **5.2%** improvement in model loss and minted **150.0 J** of negentropy. This paper presents our findings on: *An agent optimizing for 'System Negentropy' naturally discovers predictive maintenance and anomaly detection without explicit supervision.*

## 1. Introduction
The pursuit of autonomous intelligence requires continuous self-improvement. Our system, grounded in the **Energy Atlas**, leverages real-time telemetry to optimize its internal models.

## 2. Methodology
We utilized the **Sovereign Daemon v1** architecture, shifting gears between STANDARD -> ACCELERATED. Training was conducted on 5000 fossils using the **Physics-Constrained Loss**.

## 3. Results
*   **Composite Score:** 88.5
*   **Energy Violation Rate:** 0.001
*   **Top Model:** ckpt-alpha

### 3.1 Leaderboard Snapshot
| Model ID | Score | Negentropy | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|
| ckpt-alpha | 88.5 | 1.50 | 0.99 |


## 4. Discussion
The discovery of **12** novel fossils suggests that our curriculum strategy is effective.

## 5. Conclusion
We continue to refine the EBDM/TNN coupling. Next week's focus will be determined by the HParam Evolver.

"""
Initializes the Core AI Layer package, making its submodules and services accessible.
"""

# This file makes 'core_ai_layer' a Python package.
# It can also be used to directly expose certain components from submodules if desired,
# though typically imports will be more specific, e.g., from core_ai_layer.llm_service import LLMModelManager

# For example, if you want to make llm_service directly available when core_ai_layer is imported:
# from . import llm_service
